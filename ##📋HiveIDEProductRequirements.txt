**Secondary Problems**:
- Context switching between tools reduces productivity by 40%
- Code review cycles take 2-5 days on average
- Junior developers need 6+ months to become productive
- Technical debt accumulates faster than it can be addressed

### Success Metrics
- **Primary**: NL → Production-ready PR in < 5 minutes
- **Secondary**: 10x improvement in feature development velocity
- **Quality**: 95% automated test coverage, 90% first-time PR approval rate
- **Adoption**: 90% daily active usage within development teams

  As a developer
  I want to describe features in natural language
  So that I can get complete implementations quickly

Scenario: Simple feature generation
  Given I have HiveIDE running
  When I request "Add a dark mode toggle to the header"
  Then I should receive a complete implementation in < 5 minutes
  And the implementation should include:
    - React component with TypeScript
    - CSS styles with theme variables
    - Unit tests with 90%+ coverage
    - Documentation with usage examples
  And all tests should pass
  And code should follow project style guidelines

Scenario: Complex feature generation
  Given I have HiveIDE running
  When I request "Add user authentication with JWT and password reset"
  Then I should receive a complete implementation in < 5 minutes
  And the implementation should include:
    - Backend API endpoints
    - Frontend authentication flow
    - Database schema updates
    - Security best practices
    - Comprehensive test suite
  And all security scans should pass
```

#### Story 1.2: Automated Testing
```gherkin
Feature: Automated Test Execution
  As a developer
  I want tests to run automatically after code generation
  So that I can trust the quality of generated code
